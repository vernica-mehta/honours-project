\chapter{Research Plan}
\label{cha:timeline}

This chapter outlines my research plan for completing my Honours thesis by June 2026. The two major components of my project are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Programming:} Working in Python to develop and implement the training set of galaxy spectra using \tc; and
    \item \textbf{Thesis Construction:} Understanding all of the theory and context relevant to my work, as well as writing up all of the sections of the final thesis document itself.
\end{enumerate}
The projected timeline for my project, categorised into these two components, is as follows.
