\chapter{Introduction}
\label{cha:intro}

Since the 1920s, scientists have recognised the existence of galaxies outside the Milky Way \citep{sparke_galaxies_2007}. A century later, we continue to work towards attaining a full picture of the formation and evolution of galaxies. An in-depth analysis of observational and theoretical research into early galactic evolution is given in Chapter \ref{cha:lit-review}, but here I will discuss the motivations and objectives behind my own thesis. Section \ref{sec:motivation} of this chapter will motivate this study, introducing the problem statement and novelty of this proposed work. In particular, I will highlight how \textit{The Cannon}, an existing machine-learning model for determining stellar parameters, intersected with the emerging problem of resolving galactic histories from present-day spectra, to motivate this project. Objectives for my thesis will be covered in Section \ref{sec:objectives}, including a breakdown of the main goal of developing a simple training set and stretch goals of increasing complexity. I will finally outline sections of this thesis proposal in Section \ref{sec:outline}.


\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:motivation}

Machine-learning algorithms, supervised and unsupervised, have been gaining traction in astronomy due to the recent and ongoing flourishing of large-scale surveys like \sdss \citep{york_sloan_2000}, Gaia \citep{gaia_collaboration_gaia_2016}, and \desi \citep{desi_collaboration_early_2024}.
