Reconstructing the formation and evolution of galaxies from their integrated light is a longstanding challenge, hampered by the intertwined effects of multiple stellar generations, chemical enrichment, and dust. This project adapts a data‐driven machine-learning framework --- \tc \citep{ness_cannon_2015} --- to infer key galactic parameters from a single spectrum. By assembling a diverse library of synthetic galaxy spectra, I aim to train the algorithm to recognise how underlying physical parameters map onto spectral features.

My proposed approach involves a unique combination established methods, including stellar population synthesis and data-driven machine-learning. Performance validation of the model will be through cross-validation and direct comparisons between retrieved and input parameters, optimising model fidelity and assessing limits imposed by spectral resolution and noise.

The result will be a scalable, automated tool capable of delivering high‐confidence estimates of key evolutionary parameters for large spectroscopic surveys. By transforming galaxy parametrisation into a rapid, reproducible process, this work aims to accelerate studies of population demographics, environmental trends, and the cosmic history of star formation and chemical enrichment.
