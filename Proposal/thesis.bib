            The increasing size and complexity of data provided by both ongoing and planned galaxy surveys greatly contribute to our understanding of galaxy evolution. Deep learning methods are particularly well suited for handling the complex and massive data. We train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to simultaneously predict the stellar populations in galaxies: age, metallicity, colour excess E(B − V), and central velocity dispersion (VD) using spectra with redshift ≤ 0.3 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. This is the first time to use spectra based on deep learning to derive the four galaxy properties. The testing results show that our CNN predictions of galaxy properties are in good consistent with values by the traditional stellar population synthesis method with little scatters (0.11 dex for age and metallicity, 0.018 mag for E(B − V), and 31 km s−1 for VD). In terms of the computational time, our method reduces by more than 10 times compared to traditional method. We further evaluate the performance of our CNN prediction model using spectra with different signal-to-noise ratios (S/Ns), redshifts, and spectral classes. We find that our model generally exhibits good performance, although the errors at different S/Ns, redshifts, and spectral classes vary slightly. Our well-trained CNN model and related codes are publicly available on https://github.com/sddzwll/CNNforStellarp.},

	abstract = {Aims.
              This study is aimed at deriving the age and metallicity of galaxies by proposing a novel multi-modal deep learning framework. This multi-modal framework integrates spectral and photometric data, offering advantages in cases where spectra are incomplete or unavailable.
            
            
              Methods.
              We propose a multi-modal learning method for estimating the age and metallicity of galaxies (MMLforGalAM). This method uses two modalities: spectra and photometric images as training samples. Its architecture consists of four models: a spectral feature extraction model (
              ℳ
              1
              ), a simulated spectral feature generation model (
              ℳ
              2
              ), an image feature extraction model (
              ℳ
              3
              ), and a multi-modal attention regression model (
              ℳ
              4
              ). Specifically,
              ℳ
              1
              extracts spectral features associated with age and metallicity from spectra observed by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). These features are then used as labels to train
              ℳ
              2
              , which generates simulated spectral features for photometric images to address the challenge of missing observed spectra for some images. Overall,
              ℳ
              1
              and
              ℳ
              2
              provide a transformation from photometric to spectral features, with the goal of constructing a spectral representation of data pairs (photometric and spectral features) for multi-modal learning. Once
              ℳ
              2
              is trained, MMLforGalAM can then be applied to scenarios with only images, even in the absence of spectra. Then,
              ℳ
              3
              processes SDSS photometric images to extract features related to age and metallicity. Finally,
              ℳ
              4
              combines the simulated spectral features from
              ℳ
              2
              with the extracted image features from
              ℳ
              3
              to predict the age and metallicity of galaxies.
            
            
              Results.
              Trained on 36278 galaxies from SDSS, our model predicts the stellar age and metallicity, with a scatter of 1
              σ
              = 0.1506 dex for age and 1
              σ
              = 0.1402 dex for metallicity. Compared to a single-modal model trained using only images, the multi-modal approach reduces the scatter by 27\% for age and 15\% for metallicity.},

            Understanding the star formation properties of galaxies as a function of cosmic epoch is a critical exercise in studies of galaxy evolution. Traditionally, stellar population synthesis (SPS) models have been used to obtain best-fitting parameters that characterize star formation in galaxies. As multiband flux measurements become available for thousands of galaxies, an alternative approach to characterizing star formation using machine learning becomes feasible. In this work, we present the use of deep learning techniques to predict three important star formation properties – stellar mass, star formation rate, and dust luminosity. We characterize the performance of our deep learning models through comparisons with outputs from a standard SPS code.},

For emulating spectra, we use a principal component analysis to construct a set of basis functions and neural networks to learn the basis coefficients as a function of the SPS model parameters. For photometry, we parameterize the magnitudes (for the filters of interest) as a function of SPS parameters by a neural network. The resulting emulators are able to predict spectra and photometry under both simple and complicated SPS model parameterizations to percent-level accuracy, giving a factor of 10

              The spectrum of a galaxy is a complicated convolution of many properties of the galaxy, such as the star formation history (SFH), initial mass function, and metallicity. Inferring galaxy properties from the observed spectrum via spectral synthesis modeling is thus challenging. In particular, a simple yet flexible model for the SFH is required to obtain unbiased inferences. In this paper, we use SFHs from the IllustrisTNG and EAGLE simulations to test SFH models in terms of their capability of describing the simulated SFHs and the spectra generated from them. In addition to some commonly used SFH models (Γ,
              τ
              , and nonparametric), we also examine a model developed from principal component analysis (PCA), trained by a set of SFHs from IllustrisTNG. We find that when using the first five principal components (eigenhistories), the PCA-based models can achieve a good balance between simplicity and accuracy. Among the models tested, the PCA-based model provides high flexibility, by capturing diverse and complex simulated SFHs. To accurately reproduce spectra generated from the simulated SFHs, it is necessary to have a degree of freedom to describe the most recent SFH (e.g., a step function covering the age of 0–0.3 Gyr). Overall, the PCA+step model performs well in capturing the diversity of SFHs and reproducing the associated spectra, suggesting it is a promising and reliable approach for spectral synthesis modeling.},

              Galaxy observations are influenced by many physical parameters: stellar masses, star formation rates (SFRs), star formation histories (SFHs), metallicities, dust, black hole activity, and more. As a result, inferring accurate physical parameters requires high-dimensional models that capture or marginalize over this complexity. Here we reassess inferences of galaxy stellar masses and SFRs using the 14-parameter physical model
              Prospector-
              α
              built in the
              Prospector
              Bayesian inference framework. We fit the photometry of 58,461 galaxies from the 3D-
              HST
              catalogs at 0.5 {\textless} 
              z
               {\textless} 2.5. The resulting stellar masses are ∼0.1–0.3 dex larger than the fiducial masses while remaining consistent with dynamical constraints. This change is primarily due to the systematically older SFHs inferred with
              Prospector
              . The SFRs are ∼0.1–1+ dex lower than UV+IR SFRs, with the largest offsets caused by emission from “old” (
              t
               {\textgreater} 100 Myr) stars. These new inferences lower the observed cosmic SFR density by ∼0.2 dex and increase the observed stellar mass growth by ∼0.1 dex, finally bringing these two quantities into agreement and implying an older, more quiescent universe than found by previous studies at these redshifts. We corroborate these results by showing that the
              Prospector-
              α
              SFHs are both more physically realistic and much better predictors of the evolution of the stellar mass function. Finally, we highlight examples of observational data that can break degeneracies in the current model; these observations can be incorporated into priors in future models to produce new and more accurate physical parameters.},

              , SFR, and dust attenuation, and reveals previously inaccessible information about the number and duration of star formation episodes and the timing of stellar mass assembly, as well as uncertainties in these quantities. This is done using basis star formation histories (SFHs) chosen by comparing the goodness-of-fit of mock galaxy SEDs to the goodness-of-reconstruction of their SFHs. We train and validate the method using a sample of realistic SFHs at
              z
               = 1 drawn from stochastic realizations, semi-analytic models, and a cosmological hydrodynamical galaxy formation simulation. The method is then applied to a sample of 1100 CANDELS GOODS-S galaxies at
              
                
                  
                
                
              
              to illustrate its capabilities at moderate S/N with 15 photometric bands. Of the six parametrizations of SFHs considered, we adopt linear-exponential, bessel-exponential, log-normal, and Gaussian SFHs, and reject the traditional parametrizations of constant (Top-Hat) and exponential SFHs. We quantify the bias and scatter of each parametrization. 15\% of galaxies in our CANDELS sample exhibit multiple episodes of star formation, with this fraction decreasing above

	abstract = {Over the past two decades, an avalanche of new data from multiwavelength imaging and spectroscopic surveys has revolutionized our view of galaxy formation and evolution. Here we review the range of complementary techniques and theoretical tools that allow astronomers to map the cosmic history of star formation, heavy element production, and reionization of the Universe from the cosmic “dark ages” to the present epoch. A consistent picture is emerging, whereby the star-formation rate density peaked approximately 3.5 Gyr after the Big Bang, at z≈1.9, and declined exponentially at later times, with an e-folding timescale of 3.9 Gyr. Half of the stellar mass observed today was formed before a redshift z = 1.3. About 25\% formed before the peak of the cosmic star-formation rate density, and another 25\% formed after z = 0.7. Less than ∼1\% of today's stars formed during the epoch of reionization. Under the assumption of a universal initial mass function, the global stellar mass density inferred at any epoch matches reasonably well the time integral of all the preceding star-formation activity. The comoving rates of star formation and central black hole accretion follow a similar rise and fall, offering evidence for coevolution of black holes and their host galaxies. The rise of the mean metallicity of the Universe to about 0.001 solar by z = 6, one Gyr after the Big Bang, appears to have been accompanied by the production of fewer than ten hydrogen Lyman-continuum photons per baryon, a rather tight budget for cosmological reionization.},

            We apply the spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting code ProSpect to multiwavelength imaging for ∼7000 galaxies from the GAMA survey at z \&lt; 0.06, in order to extract their star formation histories. We combine a parametric description of the star formation history with a closed-box evolution of metallicity where the present-day gas-phase metallicity of the galaxy is a free parameter. We show with this approach that we are able to recover the observationally determined cosmic star formation history (CSFH), an indication that stars are being formed in the correct epoch of the Universe, on average, for the manner in which we are conducting SED fitting. We also show the contribution to the CSFH of galaxies of different present-day visual morphologies and stellar masses. Our analysis suggests that half of the mass in present-day elliptical galaxies was in place 11 Gyr ago. In other morphological types, the stellar mass formed later, up to 6 Gyr ago for present-day irregular galaxies. Similarly, the most massive galaxies in our sample were shown to have formed half their stellar mass by 11 Gyr ago, whereas the least massive galaxies reached this stage as late as 4 Gyr ago (the well-known effect of ‘galaxy downsizing’). Finally, our metallicity approach allows us to follow the average evolution in gas-phase metallicity for populations of galaxies and extract the evolution of the cosmic metal mass density in stars and in gas, producing results in broad agreement with independent, higher redshift observations of metal densities in the Universe.},

              Recent James Webb Space Telescope data analyses have shown that massive red galaxies existed at redshifts
              z
              ≳ 6, a discovery that is difficult to understand in the context of standard cosmology (ΛCDM). Here, we analyze these observations more deeply, by fitting a stellar population model to the optical and near-infrared photometric data. These fits include a main stellar population in addition to a residual younger population and with the same extinction for both (a lower extinction for the younger population is unphysical). Extra stellar populations or the inclusion of an active galactic nucleus component do not significantly improve the fits. These galaxies are being viewed at very high redshifts, with an average 〈
              z
              〉 ≈ 8.2, when the ΛCDM Universe was only ≈600 Myr old. This result conflicts with the inferred ages of these galaxies, however, which were on average between 0.9 and 2.4 Gyr old within a 95\% confidence level. Given the sequence of star formation and galaxy assembly in the standard model, these galaxies should instead be even younger than 290 Myr on average, for which our analysis assigns a probability of only {\textless}3 × 10
              −4
              (≳3.6
              σ
              tension). This outcome may indicate the need to consider nonstandard cosmologies. Nevertheless, our conclusions result from several approximations in stellar astrophysics and extinction, so they should be taken with a grain of salt. Further research is necessary to corroborate the possible existence of galaxies older than the ΛCDM Universe at their observed redshifts.},

The key controlling parameter \$β\$ can recover several existing DE models in the literature, such as the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization (\$β= 1\$), the logarithmic parametrization (in the limit \$β{\textbackslash}rightarrow 0\$), and the linear parametrization (\$β= -1\$), alongside generate a class of new DE parametrizations for other values of \$β\$. The resulting DE scenario is constrained using a suite of the latest cosmological probes, including Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature and polarization anisotropies from three different experiments (Planck 2018 and Atacama Cosmology Telescope combined with WMAP), CMB lensing, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations from DESI Year 2, and PantheonPlus from Type Ia supernovae. Our analyses reveal that stringent constraints on the DE parameters are obtained only when all cosmological probes are combined; otherwise, some parameters remain unconstrained. The present-day value of the DE EoS remains in the quintessence regime according to our results, and no significant evidence for a dynamical DE EoS is found. However, based on the \$Δχ{\textasciicircum}2\$ and Bayesian evidence analyses, we observe a mild preference for the present three-parameter DE parametrization over the CPL parametrization when all cosmological probes are taken into account. Nonetheless, the Bayesian evidence difference remains below the threshold for statistical significance according to the revised Jeffreys scale, indicating that both models are effectively equally preferred by the data.},

Compared to the 2015 results, improved measurements of large-scale polarization allow the reionization optical depth to be measured with higher precision, leading to significant gains in the precision of other correlated parameters.

	abstract = {Modeling galaxy formation in a cosmological context presents one of the greatest challenges in astrophysics today due to the vast range of scales and numerous physical processes involved. Here we review the current status of models that employ two leading techniques to simulate the physics of galaxy formation: semianalytic models and numerical hydrodynamic simulations. We focus on a set of observational targets that describe the evolution of the global and structural properties of galaxies from roughly cosmic high noon (z ∼ 2–3) to the present. Although minor discrepancies remain, overall, models show remarkable convergence among different methods and make predictions that are in qualitative agreement with observations. Modelers have converged on a core set of physical processes that are critical for shaping galaxy properties. This core set includes cosmological accretion, strong stellar-driven winds that are more efficient at low masses, black hole feedback that preferentially suppresses star formation at high masses, and structural and morphological evolution through merging and environmental processes. However, all cosmological models currently adopt phenomenological implementations of many of these core processes, which must be tuned to observations. Many details of how these diverse processes interact within a hierarchical structure formation setting remain poorly understood. Emerging multiscale simulations are helping to bridge the gap between stellar and cosmological scales, placing models on a firmer, more physically grounded footing. Concurrently, upcoming telescope facilities will provide new challenges and constraints for models, particularly by directly constraining inflows and outflows through observations of gas in and around galaxies.},

	abstract = {Numerical simulations have become a major tool for understanding galaxy formation and evolution. Over the decades the field has made significant progress. It is now possible to simulate the formation of individual galaxies and galaxy populations from well-defined initial conditions with realistic abundances and global properties. An essential component of the calculation is to correctly estimate the inflow to and outflow from forming galaxies because observations indicating low formation efficiency and strong circumgalactic presence of gas are persuasive. Energetic “feedback” from massive stars and accreting supermassive black holes—generally unresolved in cosmological simulations—plays a major role in driving galactic outflows, which have been shown to regulate many aspects of galaxy evolution. A surprisingly large variety of plausible subresolution models succeeds in this exercise. They capture the essential characteristics of the problem, i.e., outflows regulating galactic gas flows, but their predictive power is limited. In this review, we focus on one major challenge for galaxy formation theory: to understand the underlying physical processes that regulate the structure of the interstellar medium, star formation, and the driving of galactic outflows. This requires accurate physical models and numerical simulations, which can precisely describe the multiphase structure of the interstellar medium on the currently unresolved few hundred parsec scales of large-scale cosmological simulations. Such models ultimately require the full accounting for the dominant cooling and heating processes, the radiation and winds from massive stars and accreting black holes, and an accurate treatment of supernova explosions as well as the nonthermal components of the interstellar medium like magnetic fields and cosmic rays.},

            Galaxy evolution is driven by spatially distributed processes with varying time-scales. Integral field spectroscopy provides spatially resolved information about these processes. Nevertheless, disentangling these processes, which are related to both the underlying stellar populations and the interstellar medium can be challenging. We present a case study on NGC 613, observed with MUSE (Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer) for the TIMER (Time Inference with MUSE in Extragalactic Rings) project, a local barred galaxy, which shows several gas ionization mechanisms and is rich in both large and inner-scale stellar structures. We develop a set of steps to overcome fundamental problems in the modelling of emission lines with multiple components, together with the characterization of the stellar populations. That results in the disentanglement of the gas ionization mechanisms and kinematics, along with an optimal parametrization for star formation history recovery. Our analysis reveals evidence of gas inflows, which are associated with the bar dust lanes traced with Hubble Space Telescope. In addition, we show the gas kinematics in a central biconical outflow, which is aligned with a radio jet observed with Very Large Array. The emission line provides estimates of electron density, gas-phase metallicity, and the mass outflow rate, allowing us to distinguish intertwined ionization mechanisms and to identify a part of the multiphase gas cycle in NGC 613. It traces the gas kinematics from the bar lanes to inner scale gas reservoirs, where it can eventually trigger star formation or AGN activity, as observed in the outflow.},

            The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) completed its 5 month Survey Validation in 2021 May. Spectra of stellar and extragalactic targets from Survey Validation constitute the first major data sample from the DESI survey. This paper describes the public release of those spectra, the catalogs of derived properties, and the intermediate data products. In total, the public release includes good-quality spectral information from 466,447 objects targeted as part of the Milky Way Survey, 428,758 as part of the Bright Galaxy Survey, 227,318 as part of the Luminous Red Galaxy sample, 437,664 as part of the Emission Line Galaxy sample, and 76,079 as part of the Quasar sample. In addition, the release includes spectral information from 137,148 objects that expand the scope beyond the primary samples as part of a series of secondary programs. Here, we describe the spectral data, data quality, data products, Large-Scale Structure science catalogs, access to the data, and references that provide relevant background to using these spectra.},

            We investigate a series of galaxy properties computed using the merger trees and environmental histories from dark-matter–only cosmological simulations, using a semirecurrent neural network producing self-consistent predictions of galaxy evolution, and using stochastic improvements to this model based on similarly predicted Fourier transforms. We apply these methods to the dark-matter–only runs of the IllustrisTNG simulations to understand the effects of baryon removal, and to the gigaparsec-volume pure dark matter simulation Uchuu, to understand the effects of the lower resolution or alternative metrics for halo properties. We find that the machine learning model recovers accurate summary statistics derived from the predicted star formation and stellar metallicity histories, and correspondent spectroscopy and photometry. However, the inaccuracies of the model’s application to dark simulations are substantial for low-mass and slowly growing haloes. For these objects, the halo mass accretion rate is exaggerated due to the lack of stellar feedback, yet the formation of the halo can be severely limited by the absence of low-mass progenitors in a low-resolution simulation. Furthermore, differences in the structure and environment of higher mass haloes results in an overabundance of red, quenched galaxies. These results signify progress towards a machine learning model which builds high fidelity mocks based on a physical interpretation of the galaxy–halo connection, yet they illustrate the need to account for differences in halo properties and the resolution of the simulation.},

Our code is optimized to be used on the dataproducts provided by the pipe3d pipeline (or dataproducts with such a format), applied to high-spatial resolution integral field spectroscopy data (like that provided by the AMUSING++ compilation, using muse). The code provides the properties of both the underlying stellar population and the emission lines for each detected H ii candidate. Furthermore, the code delivers a novel estimation of the diffuse ionized gas (DIG) component, independent of its physical properties, which enables a decontamination of the properties of the H ii regions from the DIG. Using simulated data, mimicking the expected observations of spiral galaxies, we characterize pyhiiextractor and its ability to extract the main properties of the H ii regions (and the DIG), including the line fluxes, ratios, and equivalent widths. Finally, we compare our code with other such tools adopted in the literature, which have been developed or used for similar purposes: pyhiiexplorer, sourceextractor, hiiphot, and astrodendro. We conclude that pyhiiextractor exceeds the performance of previous tools in aspects such as the number of recovered regions and the distribution of sizes and fluxes (an improvement that is especially noticeable for the faintest and smallest regions). pyhiiextractor is therefore an optimal tool to detect candidate H ii regions, offering an accurate estimation of their properties and a good decontamination of the DIG component.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT               Bars play an important role in mixing material in the inner regions of galaxies and stimulating radial migration. Previous observations have found evidence for the impact of a bar on metallicity gradients but the effect is still inconclusive. We use the TYPHOON/PrISM survey to investigate the metallicity gradients along and beyond the bar region across the entire star-forming disc of five nearby galaxies. Using emission line diagrams to identify star-forming spaxels, we recover the global metallicity gradients ranging from −0.0162 to −0.073 dex kpc−1 with evidence that the galactic bars act as an agent in affecting in situ star formation as well as the motions of gas and stars. We observe cases with a ‘shallow-steep’ metallicity radial profile, with evidence of the bar flattening the metallicity gradients inside the bar region (NGC 5068 and NGC 1566) and also note instances where the bar appears to drive a steeper metallicity gradient producing ‘steep-shallow’ metallicity profiles (NGC 1365 and NGC 1744). For NGC 2835, a ‘steep-shallow’ metallicity gradient break occurs at a distance ∼4 times the bar radius, which is more likely driven by gas accretion to the outskirt of the galaxy instead of the bar. The variation of metallicity gradients around the bar region traces the fluctuations of star formation rate surface density in NGC 1365, NGC 1566, and NGC 1744. A larger sample combined with hydrodynamical simulations is required to further explore the diversity, and the relative importance of different ISM mixing mechanisms on the gas-phase metallicity gradients in local galaxies.},

	abstract = {We considered five galaxies in the MaNGA survey that show distinct azimuthal asymmetry in the abundance, in the sense that in the inner part (more than half of the optical radius, \$R\_\{25\}\$) of each galaxy there is a sector-like region where the oxygen abundances (O/H)\_h are higher than the abundances (O/H)\_l in other sectors. M-11761-12705 is a massive galaxy with a stellar mass of log(M\_star/M\_sun) = 11.6; the masses of four other galaxies are moderate: 10.1 \&lt; log(\$M\_star/M\_sun) \&lt; 10.4. Abundances within both high- and low-metallicity regions show flat radial gradients. The histogram for the spaxel abundances demonstrates two distinct peaks, the difference between the (O/H)\_h and the (O/H)\_l abundances are of 0.06 - 0.08 dex. The high-metallicity regions are located in the O/H - N/O diagram closer to the lower envelope of the band than the low-metallicity regions. The abundance properties in the massive galaxy can be explained by the low-metallicity gas infall onto the galaxy and subsequent starburst in the diluted interstellar gas. For moderate-mass galaxies, the higher oxygen abundance in the high-metallicity region and its shift towards the lower envelope in the N/O -- O/H diagram compared to the low-metallicity region can be explained in one of two ways: either the starburst in the high-metallicity region occurred several dozens of Myr ago, or the star formation in the galaxy is accompanied by galactic winds, and the region evolved with the lower efficiency of the enriched galactic winds shows higher metallicity. Two galaxies of our sample are members of galaxy pairs. However, the asymmetry parameter, A, quantifying the asymmetry of a light distribution across the galaxy, is above the canonical threshold (A = 0.35) between non-interacting/interacting galaxies in the massive galaxy only.},

Each H ii region has two spectral data cubes (blue-arm sampling 1.05 Å pixel−1 between 3700–5746 Å, and red-arm sampling 0.57 Å pixel−1 between 6300–7399 Å) as well as two-dimensional emission line flux maps. The spatial sampling is 0.5 arcsec across 15 arcsec fields of view, with a mean angular resolution of 2.0 arcsec (18–150 pc). We investigate seven forms of common gas–phase metallicity determinations, contrasting metallicity calibrations including the direct electron temperature method and six strong-line methods. We determine these metallicities, temperatures, densities, and ionization parameters where possible, in spatially resolved form as well as an integrated-region data set where we focus our analysis. We find varying degrees of disparity between metallicity values using different methods, and likewise between derived abundance gradients of the host galaxies. In comparisons using \$R\_\{23\}\$ metallicity as a baseline, mean disparities span 0.12–0.49 dex in oxygen abundance depending on the chosen alternative method, with a maximum of 0.65 dex when comparing against the direct electron temperature method. Host-galaxy abundance gradients deviate up to 0.66 dex in central oxygen abundance while slopes vary by up to 0.51 dex R\$\_\{25\}\$−1. The SAMI Zoom Survey provides a data set with spatial resolution, spectral coverage, and radial extent to support the study of such astrophysical processes in nearby galaxies.},

Using emission line data of NGC 628 observed with SITELLE as part of the Star formation, Ionized Gas, and Nebular Abundances Legacy Survey (SIGNALS), we use a suite of photoionization models to constrain the abundance and ionization parameters for over 1500 H ii regions throughout its disk. We measure an anticorrelation between these two properties, consistent with expectations, although with considerable scatter. Secondary trends with dust extinction and star formation rate surface density potentially explain the large scatter observed. We raise concerns throughout regarding various modeling assumptions and their impact on the observed correlations presented in the literature.},

This survey provides an unparalleled opportunity to study variations in the interstellar medium (ISM) properties within individual HII regions across the entire star-forming disks of nearby galaxies. This can provide key insights into the spatial distribution and resolved properties of the ISM to understand how efficiently metals are mixed and redistributed across spirals and dwarf galaxies. In this Proceeding, we present early science results from six nearby spiral galaxies as part of the TYPHOON program from Grasha et al. (2022). We use HIIPhot to identify the HII regions within the galaxy based on the surface brightness of the H-alpha emission line and measure variations of the HII region oxygen abundance. In this initial work, we find that while the spiral pattern plays a role in organizing the ISM, it alone does not establish the relatively uniform azimuthal variations we observe across all the galaxies. Differences in the metal abundances are more likely driven by the strong correlations with the local physical conditions. We find a strong and positive correlation between the ionization parameter and the local abundances as measured by the relative metallicity offset \$Δ\$(O/H), indicating a tight relationship between local physical conditions and their localized enrichment of the ISM. These variations can be explained by a combination of localized, star formation-driven self-enrichment and large-scale mixing-driven dilution due to the passing of spiral density waves.},

Self-consistent metallicity, ionization parameter, and pressure maps are calculated simultaneously through an iterative process to provide useful measures of the local chemical abundance and its relation to localized ISM properties. We constrain the presence of azimuthal variations in metallicity by measuring the residual metallicity offset Δ(O/H) after subtracting the linear fits to the radial metallicity profiles. We, however, find weak evidence of azimuthal variations in most of the galaxies, with small (mean 0.03 dex) scatter. The galaxies instead reveal that H ii regions with enhanced and reduced abundances are found distributed throughout the disk. While the spiral pattern plays a role in organizing the ISM, it alone does not establish the relatively uniform azimuthal variations we observe. Differences in the metal abundances are more likely driven by the strong correlations with the local physical conditions. We find a strong and positive correlation between the ionization parameter and the local abundances as measured by the relative metallicity offset Δ(O/H), indicating a tight relationship between local physical conditions and their localized enrichment of the ISM. Additionally, we demonstrate the impact of unresolved observations on the measured ISM properties by rebinning the data cubes to simulate low-resolution (1 kpc) observations, typical of large IFU surveys. We find that the ionization parameter and ISM pressure diagnostics are impacted by the loss of resolution such that their measured values are larger relative to the measured values on sub-H ii region scales.},

For each GC in the sample, we studied the MP line-of-sight, plane-of-the-sky and 3D rotation, and velocity distribution anisotropy. The differences between first-population (FP) and second-population (SP) kinematic patterns were constrained by means of parameters specifically defined to provide a global measure of the relevant physical quantities and to enable a meaningful comparison among different clusters. Our analysis provides the first observational description of the MP kinematic properties and of the path they follow during their long-term dynamical evolution. In particular, we find evidence of differences between the rotation of MPs along all velocity components with the SP preferentially rotating faster than the FP. The difference between the rotation strength of MPs is anticorrelated with the cluster dynamical age. We also observe that FPs are characterized by isotropic velocity distributions at any dynamical age probed by our sample. On the contrary, the velocity distribution of SP stars is found to be radially anisotropic in dynamically young clusters and isotropic at later evolutionary stages. The comparison with a set of numerical simulations shows that these observational results are consistent with the long-term evolution of clusters forming with an initially more centrally concentrated and more rapidly rotating SP subsystem. We discuss the possible implications these findings have on our understanding of MP formation and early evolution.},

            We present a new photometric calibration of the WFC3-UVIS and WFC3-IR detectors based on observations collected from 2009 to 2020 for four white dwarfs—namely, GRW +70 5824, GD 153 , GD 71 , G191B2B—and a G-type star, P330E. These calibrations include recent updates to the Hubble Space Telescope primary standard white dwarf models and a new reference flux for Vega. Time-dependent inverse sensitivities for the two WFC3-UVIS chips, UVIS1 and UVIS2, were calculated for all 42 full-frame filters after accounting for temporal changes in the observed count rates with respect to a reference epoch in 2009. We also derived new encircled energy values for a few filters and improved sensitivity ratios for the two WFC3-UVIS chips by correcting for sensitivity changes with time. Updated inverse sensitivity values for the 20 WFC3-UVIS quad filters and 15 WFC3-IR filters were derived by using the new models for the primary standards, the new Vega reference flux, and, in the case of the IR detector, new flat fields. However, these values do not account for any sensitivity changes with time. The new calibration provides a photometric internal precision better than 0.5\% for the wide-, medium-, and narrowband WFC3-UVIS filters; 5\% for the quad filters; and 1\% for the WFC3-IR filters. As of 2020 October 15, an updated set of photometric keywords were populated in the WFC3 image headers.},

            The ‘chromosome map’ diagram (ChM) proved a successful tool to identify and characterize multiple populations (MPs) in 59 Galactic globular clusters (GCs). Here, we construct ChMs for 11 GCs of both Magellanic Clouds (MCs) and with different ages to compare MPs in Galactic and extragalactic environments, and explore whether this phenomenon is universal through ‘place’ and ‘time’. MPs are detected in five clusters. The fractions of 1G stars, ranging from ∼50 per cent to \&gt;80 per cent, are significantly higher than those observed in Galactic GCs with similar present-day masses. By considering both Galactic and MC clusters, the fraction of 1G stars exhibits: (i) a strong anticorrelation with the present-day mass, and (ii) with the present-day mass of 2G stars; (iii) a mild anticorrelation with 1G present-day mass. All Galactic clusters without MPs have initial masses smaller than ∼1.5 · 105 M⊙ but a mass threshold governing the occurrence of MPs seems challenged by massive simple-population MC GCs; (iv) Milky Way clusters with large perigalactic distances typically host larger fractions of 1G stars, but the difference disappears when we use initial cluster masses. These facts are consistent with a scenario where the stars lost by GCs mostly belong to the 1G. By exploiting recent work based on Gaia, half of the known Type II GCs appear clustered in a distinct region of the integral of motions space, thus suggesting a common progenitor galaxy. Except for these Type II GCs, we do not find any significant difference in the MPs between clusters associated with different progenitors.},

            Our understanding of the kinematic properties of multiple stellar populations (mPOPs) in Galactic globular clusters (GCs) is still limited compared to what we know about their chemical and photometric characteristics. Such limitation arises from the lack of a comprehensive observational investigation of this topic. Here we present the first homogeneous kinematic analysis of mPOPs in 56 GCs based on high-precision proper motions computed with Hubble Space Telescope data. We focused on red-giant-branch stars, for which the mPOP tagging is clearer, and measured the velocity dispersion of stars belonging to first (1G) and second generations (2G). We find that 1G stars are generally kinematically isotropic even at the half-light radius, whereas 2G stars are isotropic at the center and become radially anisotropic before the half-light radius. The radial anisotropy is induced by a lower tangential velocity dispersion of 2G stars with respect to the 1G population, while the radial component of the motion is comparable. We also show possible evidence that the kinematic properties of mPOPs are affected by the Galactic tidal field, corroborating previous observational and theoretical results suggesting a relation between the strength of the external tidal field and some properties of mPOPs. Although limited to the GCs’ central regions, our analysis leads to new insights into the mPOP phenomenon, and provides the motivation for future observational studies of the internal kinematics of mPOPs.},

              . The assembly history experienced by the Milky Way is currently being unveiled thanks to the data provided by the
              Gaia
              mission. It is likely that the globular cluster system of our Galaxy has followed a similarly intricate formation path.
            
            
              Aims
              . To constrain this formation path, we explore the link between the globular clusters and the known merging events that the Milky Way has experienced.
            
            
              Methods
              . To this end, we combined the kinematic information provided by
              Gaia
              for almost all Galactic clusters, with the largest sample of cluster ages available after carefully correcting for systematic errors. To identify clusters with a common origin we analysed their dynamical properties, particularly in the space of integrals of motion.
            
            
              Results
              . We find that about 40\% of the clusters likely formed in situ. A similarly large fraction, 35\%, appear to be possibly associated to known merger events, in particular to
              Gaia
              -Enceladus (19\%), the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy (5\%), the progenitor of the Helmi streams (6\%), and to the Sequoia galaxy (5\%), although some uncertainty remains due to the degree of overlap in their dynamical characteristics. Of the remaining clusters, 16\% are tentatively associated to a group with high binding energy, while the rest are all on loosely bound orbits and likely have a more heterogeneous origin. The resulting age–metallicity relations are remarkably tight and differ in their detailed properties depending on the progenitor, providing further confidence on the associations made.

              . Following their birth, globular clusters (GCs) experience a very peculiar dynamical evolution. Gravitational encounters drive these systems toward energy equipartition, mass segregation, and evaporation, which alter structural, spatial, and kinematic features.
            
            
              Aims
              . We determine the dynamical state of a few GCs by means of a multi-mass King-like dynamical model. Our work focuses on the prediction of the energy equipartition degree and its relationship with model parameters.
            
            
              Methods
              . We adjusted the dynamical model parameters in order to reproduce the observed velocity dispersion – as derived from
              Hubble
              Space Telescope proper motion data – as a function of the stellar mass. By doing so, we estimated Φ
              0
              , a measure of the gravitational potential well. We repeated the same fit by means of the Bianchini relation, a function obtained by interpolating on
              N
              -body simulation results. We studied the relationship between Φ
              0
              and the Bianchini equipartition mass
              m
              eq
              and discuss the structural properties, such as concentration
              c
              , the number of core relaxation timescales
              N
              core
              , and core radius
              r
              c
              . To obtain an independent estimate of Φ
              0
              , we also fitted observed surface brightness profiles using the predicted surface density and a mass-luminosity relation from isochrones.
            
            
              Results
              . The quality of the fits of the velocity dispersion–mass relationship obtained by means of our dynamical model is comparable to those obtained with the Bianchini function. Nonetheless, when the Bianchini function is used to fit the projected velocity dispersion, the resulting degree of equipartition is underestimated. On the contrary, our approach provides the equipartition degree at any radial or projected distance by means of Φ
              0
              . As a result, a cluster in a more advanced dynamical state shows a larger Φ
              0
              , as well as larger
              N
              core
              and
              c
              , while
              r
              c
              decreases. We find the estimates of Φ
              0
              obtained by fitting surface brightness profiles to be compatible at 2
              σ
              confidence level with those from internal kinematics, although further investigation of statistical and systematic errors is required.
            
            
              Conclusions
              . Our work illustrates the predicting power of dynamical models to determine the energy equipartition degree of GCs. These models are a unique tool for determining structural and kinematic properties, and can be used where observational data are poor, as is the case for the most crowded regions of a cluster, where stars are barely resolved.},

            By means of 3D hydrodynamic simulations, we explore the effects of rotation in the formation of second-generation (SG) stars in globular clusters (GC). Our simulations follow the SG formation in a first-generation (FG) internally rotating GC; SG stars form out of FG asymptotic giant branch (AGB) ejecta and external pristine gas accreted by the system. We have explored two different initial rotational velocity profiles for the FG cluster and two different inclinations of the rotational axis with respect to the direction of motion of the external infalling gas, whose density has also been varied. For a low (10−24 g cm−3) external gas density, a disc of SG helium-enhanced stars is formed. The SG is characterized by distinct chemo-dynamical phase space patterns: it shows a more rapid rotation than the FG with the helium-enhanced SG subsystem rotating more rapidly than the moderate helium-enhanced one. In models with high external gas density (\$10{\textasciicircum}\{-23\}{\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm g{\textbackslash} cm{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\}\$), the inner SG disc is disrupted by the early arrival of external gas and only a small fraction of highly enhanced helium stars preserves the rotation acquired at birth. Variations in the inclination angle between the rotation axis and the direction of the infalling gas and the velocity profile can slightly alter the extent of the stellar disc and the rotational amplitude. The results of our simulations illustrate the complex link between dynamical and chemical properties of multiple populations and provide new elements for the interpretation of observational studies and future investigations of the dynamics of multiple-population GCs.},

Groups 1-5 are spatially linked to the Cepheus Flare star-forming region, revealing potential evidence of four sequential star formation episodes at approximately 32 Myr, 20 Myr, 15 Myr, and 7 Myr. Through dust and gas mapping, we identify a spatial cavity extending several tens of parsecs, which may have resulted from feedback processes such as supernovae associated with earlier generations of stars in the region. This structure, along with the larger Loop III feature, indicates that feedback from massive stars likely influenced the interstellar medium (ISM). By integrating young stellar populations with ISM studies, we provide a detailed picture of the feedback-driven star formation history in the Cepheus Flare region.},

            Driven by recent observational findings, we select massive interactive binaries as the most suitable among the existing candidates for producing the chemical patterns typical of multiple populations of Galactic globular clusters. Still, to avoid supernova contamination, we are further driven to endorse the notion that above a critical mass stars fail to produce supernova events, but rather eventually sink into black holes without ejecting much energy and heavy metals. This assumption has the attractive implication of suppressing star formation feedback for some 5–10 million yr, in practice leading to runaway star formation, analog to overcooling that in absence of feedback would have turned most baryons into stars in the early Universe. Under such conditions, multiple episodes of star formation, incorporating binary star ejecta from previous episodes, appear to be unavoidable, thus accounting for the ubiquity of the multiple population phenomenon in globular clusters.},

In this study, we explore the kinematics of multiple populations in the globular cluster 47 Tucanae by combining data from JWST, HST, Gaia, and ground-based telescopes. We analyzed velocity dispersion and anisotropy profiles from the cluster center out to \${\textbackslash}sim\$10\$R\_h\$. Our findings indicate that while first population (1G) stars' motions are isotropic, second population (2G) stars' motions are significantly radially anisotropic. These results align with the predictions of simulations of the dynamical evolution of clusters where 2G stars are initially more centrally concentrated than 1G stars. Furthermore, we subdivided the 2G population into two subpopulations: \$2G\_A\$ and \$2G\_B\$, with the latter being more chemically extreme. We compared their dynamical profiles and found no significant differences. For the first time, we measured the degree of energy equipartition among the multiple populations of 47 Tucanae. Overall, within the analyzed radial range (\${\textbackslash}sim\$2-4\$R\_h\$), both populations exhibit a low degree of energy equipartition. The most significant differences between 1G and 2G stars are observed in the tangential velocity component, where 2G stars are characterized by a stronger degree of energy equipartition than 1G stars. In the radial component, the behavior of 1G and 2G stars is more variable, with differences largely dependent on radius. Moreover, our analysis reveals that the ratio of rotational velocity to velocity dispersion is larger for the 2G population. Finally, we found that 1G stars exhibit higher skewness in their tangential proper motions than 2G stars, providing additional evidence of kinematic differences between the two stellar generations.},

We have performed a set of N-body simulations to follow the internal evolution of clusters with different degrees of initial rotation and have explored the evolution of the rotational velocity, the degree of energy equipartition, and anisotropy in the velocity distribution. Our simulations show that (1) as the cluster evolves, the rotational velocity develops a dependence on the stellar mass with more massive stars characterized by a more rapid rotation and a peak in the rotation curve closer to the cluster centre than low-mass stars; (2) the degree of energy equipartition in the cluster’s intermediate and outer regions depends on the component of the velocity dispersion measured; for more rapidly rotating clusters, the evolution towards energy equipartition is more rapid in the direction of the rotational velocity; (3) the anisotropy in the velocity distribution is stronger for massive stars; and (4) both the degree of mass segregation and energy equipartition are characterized by spatial anisotropy; they have a dependence on both R and z, correlated with the flattening in the spatial variation of the cluster’s density and velocity dispersion, as shown by 2D maps of the mass segregation and energy equipartition on the (R–z) meridional plane.},

              Aims.
              The goal of this paper is to demonstrate the outstanding quality of the second data release of the
              Gaia
              mission and its power for constraining many different aspects of the dynamics of the satellites of the Milky Way. We focus here on determining the proper motions of 75 Galactic globular clusters, nine dwarf spheroidal galaxies, one ultra-faint system, and the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds.
            
            
              Methods.
              Using data extracted from the
              Gaia
              archive, we derived the proper motions and parallaxes for these systems, as well as their uncertainties. We demonstrate that the errors, statistical and systematic, are relatively well understood. We integrated the orbits of these objects in three different Galactic potentials, and characterised their properties. We present the derived proper motions, space velocities, and characteristic orbital parameters in various tables to facilitate their use by the astronomical community.
            
            
              Results.
              Our limited and straightforward analyses have allowed us for example to (
              i
              ) determine absolute and very precise proper motions for globular clusters; (

Different mean proper motions have been detected among the three main sub-populations, implying that the most metal-rich one is of accreted origin. This particular piece of evidence has been a matter of debate because the available data have either not been sufficiently precise or limited to a small region of the cluster to ultimately confirm or refute the result. Using astrometry from the second Gaia data release and recent high-quality, multi-band photometry, we are now in a position to resolve the controversy. We reproduced the original analysis using the Gaia data and found that the three populations have the same mean proper motion. Thus, there is no need to invoke an accreted origin for the most metal-rich sub-population.},

We determine distances either directly from the Gaia EDR3 parallaxes, or kinematically by combining line-of-sight velocity dispersion profiles with Gaia EDR3 and HST-based proper motion velocity dispersion profiles. We furthermore calculate cluster distances from fitting nearby subdwarfs, whose absolute luminosities we determine from their Gaia EDR3 parallaxes, to globular cluster main sequences. We finally use HST-based stellar number counts to determine distances. We find good agreement in the average distances derived from the different methods down to a level of about 2 per cent. Combining all available data, we are able to derive distances to 162 Galactic globular clusters, with the distances to about 20 nearby globular clusters determined with an accuracy of 1 per cent or better. We finally discuss the implications of our distances for the value of the local Hubble constant.},

We measure the mean parallaxes and proper motions (PM) for 170 clusters, determine the PM dispersion profiles for more than 100 clusters, uncover rotation signatures in more than 20 objects, and find evidence for radial or tangential PM anisotropy in a dozen richest clusters. At the same time, we use the selection of cluster members to explore the reliability and limitations of the Gaia catalogue itself. We find that the formal uncertainties on parallax and PM are underestimated by \$10\{-\}20\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$ in dense central regions even for stars that pass numerous quality filters. We explore the spatial covariance function of systematic errors, and determine a lower limit on the uncertainty of average parallaxes and PM at the level 0.01 mas and 0.025 mas yr\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ , respectively. Finally, a comparison of mean parallaxes of clusters with distances from various literature sources suggests that the parallaxes for stars with \$G{\textgreater}13\$ (after applying the zero-point correction suggested by Lindegren et al.) are overestimated by \${\textbackslash}sim 0.01{\textbackslash}pm 0.003\$ mas. Despite these caveats, the quality of Gaia astrometry has been significantly improved in EDR3 and provides valuable insights into the properties of star clusters.},

It is the result of a thorough revision of the major input physics, together with the inclusion of the pre-main sequence phase, not present in our previous releases of stellar models. Another innovative aspect is the possibility of promptly generating accurate opacity tables fully consistent with any selected initial chemical composition, by coupling the Opacity Project At Livermore (OPAL) data at high temperatures to the molecular opacities computed with our æSOPUS code. In this work, we present extended sets of stellar evolutionary models for various initial chemical compositions, while other sets with different metallicities and/or different distributions of heavy elements are being computed. For the present release of models, we adopt the solar distribution of heavy elements from the recent revision by Caffau et al., corresponding to a Sun's metallicity Z ≃ 0.0152. From all computed sets of stellar tracks, we also derive isochrones in several photometric systems. The aim is to provide the community with the basic tools to model star clusters and galaxies by means of population synthesis techniques.},

	abstract = {Understanding the formation of multiple populations in globular clusters (GCs) represents a challenge for stellar population studies. Nevertheless, the outermost cluster regions, likely to hold clues about the initial configuration of GC stars, remain underexplored. We use synthetic spectra reflecting the chemical compositions of first- and second-population (1P, 2P) stars in 47 Tucanae to identify spectral regions sensitive to these populations. This led us to define new photometric bands that effectively distinguish 1P and 2P giant stars using Gaia XP spectra. Testing these filters, we constructed the pseudo two-colour diagrams dubbed chromosome maps (ChMs) and, for the first time, identified 1P and 2P stars in the cluster's outermost regions and beyond its tidal radius. We constructed similar diagrams for NGC 3201, NGC 6121, NGC 6752, and NGC 6397, thus exploring GCs with different metallicities. The ChMs effectively distinguished multiple populations in the outer regions of all clusters, except for the metal-poor NGC 6397. Our findings, together with literature results from more-internal regions, show that the 2P stars of 47 Tucanae are more-centrally concentrated than the 1P. A similar pattern is seen for 2P stars with extreme chemical composition of NGC 3201. The multiple populations of NGC 6121, and NGC 6752 share the same radial distributions. These radial behaviours are consistent with the GC formation scenarios where 2P stars originate in the central regions. Noticeably, results on NGC 3201 are in tension with the conclusion from recent work that its 1P is more centrally concentrated than the 2P and might form with more central concentration.},

              . The spectroscopic and photometric classification of multiple stellar populations (MPs) in Galactic globular clusters (GCs) has enabled comparisons between contemporary observations and formation theories regarding the initial spatial configurations of the MPs. However, the kinematics of these MPs is an aspect that requires more attention. We investigated the 3D kinematics of 30 Galactic GCs, extending to 3–5 half-light radii, as well as their MPs, in order to uncover clues of the initial conditions of GCs and the MPs within.
            
            
              Methods
              . We have combined Hubble Space Telescope and
              Gaia
              DR3 proper motions together with a comprehensive set of line-of- sight velocities to determine the 3D rotation amplitudes, rotation axes, and anisotropy profiles of the clusters. We include additional radial velocities from new IFU observations of NGC 5024 and an analysis of archival MUSE data of NGC 6101. We compare our kinematic results with structural and orbital parameters of each cluster, reporting the most significant correlations and common features.
            
            
              Results
              . We find significant ({\textgreater}3
              σ
              ) rotation in 21 GCs, with no significant differences between the total rotational amplitudes of the MPs, except for NGC 104. We find no significant differences in the position angles of the rotation axis or inclination angles. We find that the 3D rotational amplitude of the clusters in our sample is strongly correlated with their mass, relaxation time, enriched star fraction, and concentration. We determined the anisotropy profiles of each cluster and the MPs where possible. We investigated correlations with the structural parameters, orbital parameters, and accretion history of the clusters from their progenitor systems, finding that the dynamically young clusters with the highest central concentrations of primordial stars exhibit radial anisotropy in their outer regions ({\textgreater}2 half-light radii). The dynamically young clusters with a central concentration of enriched stars show significant tangential anisotropy or isotropy in their outer regions.},

            Several observational studies have shown that many Galactic globular clusters (GCs) are characterized by internal rotation. Theoretical studies of the dynamical evolution of rotating clusters have predicted that, during their long-term evolution, these stellar systems should develop a dependence of the rotational velocity around the cluster’s centre on the mass of stars, with the internal rotation increasing for more massive stars. In this paper, we present the first observational evidence of the predicted rotation–mass trend. In our investigation, we exploited the Gaia Data Release 3 catalogue of three GCs: NGC 104 (47 Tuc), NGC 5139 (ω Cen), and NGC 5904 (M 5). We found clear evidence of a cluster rotation–mass relation in 47 Tuc and M 5, while in ω Cen, the dynamically youngest system among the three clusters studied here, no such trend was detected.},

            A number of studies based on the data collected by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) GO-13297 program “HST Legacy Survey of Galactic Globular Clusters: Shedding UV Light on Their Populations and Formation” have investigated the photometric properties of a large sample of Galactic globular clusters and revolutionized our understanding of their stellar populations. In this paper, we expand upon previous studies by focusing our attention on the stellar clusters’ internal kinematics. We computed proper motions for stars in 56 globular clusters and one open cluster by combining the GO-13297 images with archival HST data. The astrophotometric catalogs released with this paper represent the most complete and homogeneous collection of proper motions of stars in the cores of stellar clusters to date, and expand the information provided by the current (and future) Gaia data releases to much fainter stars and into the crowded central regions. We also census the general kinematic properties of stellar clusters by computing the velocity dispersion and anisotropy radial profiles of their bright members. We study the dependence on concentration and relaxation time, and derive dynamical distances. Finally, we present an in-depth kinematic analysis of the globular cluster NGC 5904.},

              We present an account of the state of the art in the fields explored by the research community invested in “Modeling and Observing DEnse STellar systems”. For this purpose, we take as a basis the activities of the MODEST-17 conference, which was held at Charles University, Prague, in September 2017. Reviewed topics include recent advances in fundamental stellar dynamics, numerical methods for the solution of the gravitational
              N
              -body problem, formation and evolution of young and old star clusters and galactic nuclei, their elusive stellar populations, planetary systems, and exotic compact objects, with timely attention to black holes of different classes of mass and their role as sources of gravitational waves.
            
            Such a breadth of topics reflects the growing role played by collisional stellar dynamics in numerous areas of modern astrophysics. Indeed, in the next decade many revolutionary instruments will enable the derivation of positions and velocities of individual stars in the Milky Way and its satellites, and will detect signals from a range of astrophysical sources in different portions of the electromagnetic and gravitational spectrum, with an unprecedented sensitivity. On the one hand, this wealth of data will allow us to address a number of long-standing open questions in star cluster studies; on the other hand, many unexpected properties of these systems will come to light, stimulating further progress of our understanding of their formation and evolution.},

	abstract = {Line-of-sight kinematic studies indicate that many Galactic globular clusters have a significant degree of internal rotation. However, three-dimensional kinematics from a combination of proper motions and line-of-sight velocities are needed to unveil the role of angular momentum in the formation and evolution of these old stellar systems. Here we present the first quantitative study of internal rotation on the plane-of-the-sky for a large sample of globular clusters using proper motions from Gaia DR2. We detect signatures of rotation in the tangential component of proper motions for 11 out of 51 clusters at a \${\textgreater}\$3-sigma confidence level, confirming the detection reported in Gaia collaboration et al. (2018) for 8 clusters, and additionally identify 11 GCs with a 2-sigma rotation detection. For the clusters with a detected global rotation, we construct the two-dimensional rotation maps and proper motion rotation curves, and we assess the relevance of rotation with respect to random motions (\$V/{\textbackslash}sigma{\textbackslash}sim0.08-0.51\$). We find evidence of a correlation between the degree of internal rotation and relaxation time, highlighting the importance of long-term dynamical evolution in shaping the clusters current properties. This is a strong indication that angular momentum must have played a fundamental role in the earliest phases of cluster formation. Finally, exploiting the spatial information of the rotation maps and a comparison with line-of-sight data, we provide an estimate of the inclination of the rotation axis for a subset of 8 clusters. Our work demonstrates the potential of Gaia data for internal kinematic studies of globular clusters and provides the first step to reconstruct their intrinsic three-dimensional structure.},

For most clusters in the sample, this is the first energy equipartition study ever performed. This study is also the largest of its kind, albeit with only nine clusters. We begin by rigorously cleaning the catalogs to remove poor-quality measurements and to ensure high signal to noise for the study. Using the cleaned catalogs, we investigate how velocity dispersion σ changes with stellar mass m. We fit two functional forms: the first, a classic power law of the form σ ∝ m −η where η is the degree of energy equipartition, and the second from Bianchini et al. parameterized by an equipartition mass m eq where η changes with stellar mass. We find that both functions fit well but cannot distinguish with statistical significance which function provides the best fit. All clusters exhibit varying degrees of partial equipartition; no cluster is at or near full equipartition. We search for correlations of η and m eq with various cluster properties. The most significant correlation is observed with the number of core or median relaxation times ( or N half) the cluster has experienced. Finally, we determine the radial equipartition profile for each cluster, that is, how the degree of equipartition changes with projected distance from the cluster center. We do not detect statistically significant trends in the degree of equipartition with radius. Overall, our observational findings are in broad agreement with theoretical predictions from N -body models published in recent years.},

Because of this, GCs serve as excellent tracers of the formation, structure, and merger history of their host galaxies. My dissertation will examine both the photometric and kinematic properties of GC systems and their relationship to their host galaxies.      In the first section, I will present the analysis of the GC systems of two spiral galaxies, NGC 891 and NGC 1055.  I will discuss the photometric methods used to detect GCs using wide-field BVR imaging and to quantify the global properties of the system such as the total number of GCs and their radial distribution.  My results for these two GC systems were compared to those of other galaxies.     I will also present the results of spectroscopic follow-up for two giant galaxies: the S0 galaxy NGC 4594 (M104), and the elliptical galaxy NGC 3379 (M105).  I measured the radial velocities of GCs in these two galaxies, and combined them with published results to determine the mass distribution and mass-to-light (M/L) ratio profile for each galaxy out to large effective radius (7-9 Re). For both galaxies, I found that the  M/L profiles increase with radius and do not flatten, which suggests that the dark matter halos in these galaxies extend to the edge of my data. I also looked for evidence of rotation in the GC systems, and found that neither system exhibits significant rotation around the host galaxy. I examined the velocity dispersion profile of each GC system and found kinematic differences between the red and blue GC subpopulations.  Finally, I compared my results to mass estimates for these galaxies from other kinematic tracers and considered them in the context of galaxy formation models.},
